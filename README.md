We have used library's in our project, which needs to be imported, 
before the application can run. 

The library's you need to import, can be found under the "lib" folder. 

[mp3agic-0.9.1.jar](lib%2Fmp3agic-0.9.1.jar)

[materialfx-11.13.5.jar](lib%2Fmaterialfx-11.13.5.jar)

[virtualizedfx-11.2.6.jar](lib%2Fvirtualizedfx-11.2.6.jar)

In case you want to open the program in SceneBuilder, will you 
need to add the materialfx in there as well.
